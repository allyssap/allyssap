Hi 👋 My name is Allyssa(she/her)
===============================  
Software Developer 
------------------  
The first programming language I started to learn was HTML, and that was over a decade ago! I am so lucky to have found that my passions for problem solving and math work perfectly for my career as a software engineer. I am currently seeking a software engineering position! I am interested in embedded programming, graphics and software development roles.
